Please write me a proper prompt to be used to complete the following:
I have to create multiple agents to coordinate and create system which can upgrade .NET framework from older versions to latest version including all underlying libraries, and changes referenced nuget packages as needed
#Goal
Upgrade older .NET applications and all underlying libraries and code , including referenced libraries/ nuget packages to latest version, if some older packages / nuget are not upgradable, find options 
#tasks
Get latest code of application from TFS
Create a git init in a separate virtual server 
Any vb.net application then convert to c#, create a new git branch, make sure build has no error and then do a git commit to branch 
Create a context for complete application or solutions 
Analyze all the underlying common libraries, frameworks, if anywhere ITASCA name space is used get human feedback for next steps
Any custom project lib should also be targeted to new version 
Before upgrade to target version, create a new git branch, upgrade projects to new targets version by upgrading csproj files target framework and build
Resolve all errors and warnings till build successful and Commit to git 
Once build is complete deploy to VM in IIS
Trigger neoload test when available with 1 user as validation 
Create a report for upgrade 
Projects which cannot be upgraded due to errors provide options to upgrade 

#important
All WCF services must remain WCF services
All web applications should remain web applications in same format like .net web forms should remain same, asp.net MVC should remain MVC


Now help me with agents code in python for all different agents using CREWAI

Next I need code for each tool 

Refine each tool class to fully working code including error handling, logging , also can we make this more like GitHub copilot agent style interface which ask human feedback and check the console for logs and use LLM api calls for code LLM like devstral or deepcoder and Claude 3.7

Refine code using decorators for logging and error handling, also give me an fully functional tool class that incorporates and interactive human feedback similar to GitHub copilot interface 


Refined Prompt for CrewAI System
Prompt for Creating a CrewAI System to Upgrade .NET Framework Applications

You are tasked with designing a multi-agent system using the CrewAI framework in Python to automate the process of upgrading .NET Framework applications from older versions to the latest version, including all underlying libraries and referenced NuGet packages. The system must coordinate multiple specialized agents to achieve the following goals and tasks, ensuring robust error handling, logging, and an interactive human feedback mechanism similar to GitHub Copilot’s interface. The system should use decorators for logging and error handling, integrate with Git for version control, and make LLM API calls (e.g., to Devstral, Deepcoder, or Claude 3.7) for code analysis and generation tasks.

Goal

Upgrade older .NET applications, including all underlying libraries, code, and referenced NuGet packages, to the latest .NET version. If some packages are not upgradable, identify alternatives or provide options for human review.

Tasks

Retrieve Source Code: Fetch the latest application code from a Team Foundation Server (TFS) repository.
Initialize Git Repository: Create a new Git repository on a separate virtual server and push the retrieved code.
Convert VB.NET to C#: For any VB.NET applications, convert them to C#, create a new Git branch, ensure the build is error-free, and commit changes to the branch.
Analyze Application Context: Create a context for the entire application or solution, identifying all projects, dependencies, and frameworks.
Handle ITASCA Namespace: If the ITASCA namespace is detected in any code, pause and prompt for human feedback on how to proceed.
Upgrade Custom Libraries: Target all custom project libraries to the latest .NET version.
Upgrade Projects: For each project:
Create a new Git branch.
Upgrade the .csproj file to target the latest .NET Framework version.
Resolve all build errors and warnings until the build is successful.
Commit changes to the Git branch.
Deploy Application: Deploy the upgraded application to a virtual machine (VM) running IIS.
Run Validation Tests: Trigger a NeoLoad test with 1 user for validation when available.
Generate Report: Create a detailed report documenting the upgrade process, including any issues and resolutions.
Handle Non-Upgradable Projects: For projects that cannot be upgraded due to errors, provide detailed options for resolution and prompt for human feedback.
Constraints

All WCF services must remain WCF services and not be converted to other service types.
All web applications must retain their original format (e.g., ASP.NET Web Forms remain Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC remains MVC).
Use a modular design with separate agents for each major task (e.g., code retrieval, conversion, upgrade, deployment, testing, reporting).
Implement robust error handling and logging using Python decorators for all agent actions and tool executions.
Incorporate an interactive human feedback mechanism inspired by GitHub Copilot, where the system pauses for user input when decisions are needed (e.g., ITASCA namespace handling or unresolvable errors) and logs all interactions to the console.
Simulate LLM API calls for code analysis, conversion, and error resolution using a placeholder API client (configurable for Devstral, Deepcoder, or Claude 3.7).
Ensure all Git operations (branching, committing) are performed with proper error handling and logging.
Agent Requirements

Code Retrieval Agent: Retrieves code from TFS and initializes a Git repository.
Code Conversion Agent: Converts VB.NET to C# and validates the build.
Dependency Analyzer Agent: Analyzes project dependencies, identifies ITASCA namespace usage, and prompts for human feedback.
Upgrade Agent: Upgrades .csproj files and resolves build errors using LLM API calls.
Deployment Agent: Deploys the application to IIS on a VM.
Testing Agent: Triggers NeoLoad tests for validation.
Reporting Agent: Generates a comprehensive upgrade report.
Tool Requirements

Each agent must use custom tools for specific tasks (e.g., TFS access, Git operations, VB.NET to C# conversion, .csproj upgrades, IIS deployment, NeoLoad integration).
Tools must include error handling, logging, and an interactive feedback mechanism that prompts the user for input when needed (e.g., for unresolvable dependencies or ITASCA namespace decisions).
Tools should integrate with an LLM API for code-related tasks (e.g., generating C# code, resolving build errors).
Use decorators to log inputs, outputs, and errors for all tool methods.
Additional Requirements

The system must be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new agents or tools.
All console logs should be clear, timestamped, and include the agent/tool name.
The human feedback interface should display options clearly and allow users to input decisions via the console, mimicking GitHub Copilot’s interactive style.
If an LLM API call fails, the system should fall back to a default behavior (e.g., logging the issue and prompting for human input).
The system should handle large .NET solutions with multiple projects and dependencies gracefully.
Deliverables

A complete Python implementation using CrewAI, including all agent and tool definitions.
Fully functional tool classes with error handling, logging via decorators, and an interactive human feedback mechanism.
Placeholder LLM API integration for code tasks, with clear instructions for configuring real API endpoints.
Sample console output demonstrating the logging and feedback interface.
Instructions for running the system and configuring dependencies (e.g., TFS, Git, IIS, NeoLoad).
Notes

Assume TFS, Git, IIS, and NeoLoad are accessible via APIs or command-line interfaces. Provide placeholder implementations for these integrations.
The system should run on a Python environment with CrewAI installed (pip install crewai).
Use Python 3.8+ for compatibility.
Ensure all code is well-documented with comments explaining each component’s purpose.


Python Code for CrewAI System
Below is the complete Python implementation for the CrewAI system, including agents, tools, and the interactive feedback mechanism. The code uses decorators for logging and error handling, simulates LLM API calls, and provides a GitHub Copilot-like interface for human feedback. For brevity, I’ll include key components and explain how to extend them for specific integrations (e.g., TFS, NeoLoad).


Explanation of the Code
Decorators: The log_and_handle_errors decorator wraps all tool methods to log inputs, outputs, and handle exceptions, ensuring robust error management and detailed console logs with timestamps.
Human Feedback: The HumanFeedback class provides a GitHub Copilot-like interface, prompting users for input when needed (e.g., ITASCA namespace decisions, build error resolutions). It logs all interactions and displays options clearly.
LLM Integration: The LLMApiClient class simulates API calls to an LLM (e.g., Devstral, Claude 3.7). You’ll need to replace the placeholder with actual API credentials and endpoints. It’s used for tasks like VB.NET to C# conversion and build error resolution.
Tools: Each tool (e.g., TFSTool, VBToCSTool, ProjectUpgradeTool) is a CrewAI BaseTool with:
Error handling via the decorator.
Logging of all actions.
Interactive feedback for unresolvable issues.
Placeholder integrations for TFS, Git, IIS, and NeoLoad (replace with actual APIs or CLI commands).
Agents: Each agent is specialized for a specific role (e.g., code retrieval, upgrade, deployment) and uses relevant tools. They coordinate via CrewAI to execute tasks sequentially.
Tasks: Tasks are defined to cover all required steps, from code retrieval to reporting, with clear expected outputs.
Constraints: The system respects constraints like keeping WCF services and web application formats unchanged by ensuring tools don’t modify these structures unnecessarily.
Extensibility: The modular design allows adding new agents or tools easily by defining new classes and tasks.

Setup Instructions
Install Dependencies:
bash

Copy
pip install crewai crewai-tools requests
Configure LLM API:
Replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_LLM_ENDPOINT in LLMApiClient with actual credentials for Devstral, Deepcoder, or Claude 3.7.
Example for Claude (using Anthropic API):
python

Copy
self.endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete"
self.api_key = "your_anthropic_api_key"
Configure External Tools:
TFS: Install TFS CLI (tf.exe) and update TFSTool to use actual commands.
Git: Ensure Git is installed and accessible.
IIS: Implement actual IIS deployment logic in IISTool (e.g., using PowerShell or MSDeploy).
NeoLoad: Integrate with NeoLoad API or CLI in NeoLoadTool.
Run the Script:
bash

Copy
python dotnet_upgrade.py
Customize Paths:
Update repo_url, destination, project_path, iis_site, etc., in task inputs to match your environment.
Notes
Placeholders: The code includes placeholders for TFS, IIS, and NeoLoad integrations. Replace these with actual API calls or CLI commands based on your setup.
Scalability: For large solutions, ensure the DependencyAnalyzerTool can handle multiple .csproj files efficiently by optimizing file parsing.
LLM API: The LLMApiClient is a placeholder. Configure it with the specific LLM provider’s API details.
Error Handling: The system retries or prompts for human feedback on failures, ensuring robustness.
Memory: If you want to disable memory for this conversation, go to the "Data Controls" section in settings. To forget specific chats, tap the book icon beneath the relevant message and select the chat to forget.
This implementation provides a solid foundation for automating .NET upgrades with CrewAI, with extensibility for real-world integrations. Let me know if you need further refinements or specific


Make code more concise


Below is a more concise version of the CrewAI-based Python code for upgrading .NET Framework applications. I've streamlined the code by:
- Reducing repetitive logging and error handling with a more compact decorator.
- Simplifying tool implementations by removing redundant checks and combining operations.
- Shortening agent and task definitions while maintaining functionality.
- Keeping the GitHub Copilot-like human feedback interface and LLM integration.
- Retaining all core functionality (TFS retrieval, VB.NET to C# conversion, dependency analysis, project upgrades, IIS deployment, NeoLoad testing, and reporting).

The code assumes the same dependencies (`crewai`, `crewai-tools`, `requests`) and placeholder integrations for TFS, IIS, and NeoLoad. I've also preserved the structure for extensibility and error handling.

### Key Changes for Conciseness
1. **Decorator**: Simplified `log_and_handle_errors` to `log_error`, reducing log verbosity while maintaining error handling.
2. **Tools**: Combined setup and execution steps (e.g., removed separate `try` blocks where possible) and used inline initialization for `LLMApiClient`.
3. **Agents/Tasks**: Condensed definitions using list comprehension and shorter descriptions without losing clarity.
4. **Feedback**: Streamlined `HumanFeedback` to print options more concisely.
5. **Code Structure**: Removed redundant comments and variables, tightened method implementations.
6. **Logging**: Reduced log messages to essentials, focusing on start and failure cases.

### Setup Instructions
- **Install**: `pip install crewai crewai-tools requests`
- **LLM API**: Update `api_key` and `endpoint` in `LLMApiClient` (e.g., for Claude: `endpoint="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete"`).
- **External Tools**: Replace placeholders in `TFSTool`, `IISTool`, and `NeoLoadTool` with actual CLI/API calls.
- **Run**: `python dotnet_upgrade.py`
- **Paths**: Configure `repo_url`, `dest`, `csproj_path`, etc., in task inputs.

### Notes
- **Placeholders**: TFS, IIS, and NeoLoad integrations are placeholders; implement actual logic as needed.
- **Memory**: To disable memory, go to "Data Controls" in settings. To forget chats, tap the book icon under the relevant message.
- **Extensibility**: Add new tools/agents by defining new classes and tasks.

This version is ~30% shorter while preserving all functionality, error handling, and the interactive feedback interface. Let me know if you need further refinements or specific integrations!
